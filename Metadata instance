Retrieve Metadata of an instance:
Let’s say I have EC2 instance in AWS and would like to retrieve the metadata of that instance through CURL
Metadata -----> Information about the Instance
User data------> Script used to launch the Instance
Now, I’m connecting to EC2 instance through SSH and ensuring that I have the curl installed in that instance. Once, the authentication is successful by verifying with the key, the screen should look something like as and we use the following URL to view the metadata instance
ec2-user@ip address--> Curl  http://169.254.169.254/latest/
This will display the metadata and user data
ec2-user@ip address--> Curl  http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata/ 
This will display the contents like hostname, instance id, lifecycle, action etc
ec2-user@ip address--> Curl  http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata/ instance-type/
Now, to convert it into Json format
ec2-user@ip address--> Curl  http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata/ instance-type/&format=json/
